## stack fuel cells balance survey

### Improvements
 * Additional sizes of stock/stack/fuselage fuel cells?
 * What EC/s desired?
 * Consumption?
 * Patches for stock pods? what specs?
 * Additional Features

### Balance Issues
 * Adjustments suggested for consumption/production/byproducts?

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
 This discussion concerns .1 meter high stack fuel cells.

Each module contains the fuel cell, fuel tank (in units) and a battery module. These will be released shortly in another (related) parts only mod which is being prepped for release.

I want your input as to the game balance of each of the sizes, and where on the tech tree they should appear

Don't want to use Tweakscale on these due to the need for fine tuning game balance.

Fuselage versions (mk0-mk5) are included just in case a model/texture can be found/provided that will allow these to be created/included.

Thank you in advance!

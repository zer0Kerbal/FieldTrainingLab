This mod provides Training method with consuming Science points.
Paying 20 sci, your kerbal can get 1 exp. Since leveling up method is very limited, you have to pay science point once enough to advance level.

If your Training Lab is in orbit, Training costs will be reduced 50%.
If your Lab is on other planet, Training costs will be reduced by 75%.

You can tweak values by editing .cfg. If you want, you can add this module to other crewed part. It can support up to 8 kerbalnauts.

 

Leveling up 'Immediately' is not realistic? Do you think Training needs time consuming? This mod will be answer for you. ![FieldTrainingFacility](https://github.com/zer0Kerbal/FieldTrainingFacility)
